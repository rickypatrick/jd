The terms "massage therapist" and "masseur" both refer to individuals who provide massage services, but there are some key differences in how these terms are used and the connotations they carry:

1. **Massage Therapist**:

   * A massage therapist is a professional who has undergone formal training in various massage techniques, anatomy, and physiology.
   * They often have a state or nationally recognized license or certification, depending on the country and region.
   * Massage therapists are typically trained to provide therapeutic massages that address specific health issues or provide relaxation.
   * Their training may include a variety of massage modalities, such as Swedish massage, deep tissue massage, sports massage, and more.
   * Massage therapists often work in clinical settings, spas, wellness centers, or private practices, and they may be part of a healthcare team for clients seeking massage therapy for medical purposes.
2. **Masseur**:

   * The term "masseur" is somewhat outdated and less commonly used today.
   * Historically, it was used to refer to a male massage therapist. The female counterpart was often called a "masseuse."
   * However, the terms "masseur" and "masseuse" have fallen out of favor because they can be associated with less professional or therapeutic massage services.
   * In many places, these terms have been replaced by "massage therapist" or "bodyworker" to be more gender-neutral and emphasize the professionalism and therapeutic nature of the work.

In modern times, the term "massage therapist" is preferred because it conveys a professional and therapeutic approach to massage. It is inclusive of both male and female practitioners and reflects the extensive training and knowledge required to provide effective massage therapy. If you are seeking massage services, it's advisable to look for a licensed or certified massage therapist who is trained to meet your specific needs, whether they be for relaxation or therapeutic purposes.
